/**
 * @brief Schedules a callback after a certain time interval.
 *
 * This function is used by MDNS to perform probing and announcements at
 * regular intervals. Only one callback can be scheduled at any point in
 * time.
 *
 * @param time
 * Specifies the time in milliseconds after which the callback should be
 * executed. This is a relative time from now.
 *
 * @param callback
 * The callback to invoke after the time has expired.
 *
 * @retval UMDNS_OK
 * The callback was scheduled successfully.
 *
 * @retval UMDNS_ERR_ALREADY_SCHEDULED
 * A callback is already scheduled.
 *
 * @retval UMDNS_ERR_FAILED
 * The callback could not be scheduled due to other errors.
 *
 * @remarks
 * If a callback fails to be scheduled the uMDNS stack shuts down as the
 * external state potentially becomes corrupted. This basically causes
 * all MDNS reservations to become unreserved. Goodbye network packets are
 * sent.
